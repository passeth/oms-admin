# OMS Admin Roadmap

## 1. UI/UX & Navigation Optimization

## 2. BOM & Inventory Management

- [ ] **Dispatch Aggregation Page**: 
    - Create a view to calculate total required quantities for shipping.
    - Logic: Explode orders into atomic SKUs using BOMs.
    - Display total counts to guide warehouse picking/packing.

## 3. Dashboard & Analytics
- [ ] **Sales Overview**:
    - Daily/Weekly/Monthly sales trends.
    - Status monitoring (New vs Done).
    - Best-selling products/kits.
- [ ] **Visuals**: Implement charts (e.g., using Recharts) for better visibility.

## 4. Documentation
